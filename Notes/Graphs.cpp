Each vertex will have a list of all adjacent vertex nodes
When we get a pointer to the vertex, we can access the adjacency list.
{ [temp -> adjList[2].v] -> adjList[0].c } pueblo
We use array notation to access the list
Inside, the list we access each specific pointer
With the point, we access v, or the weight (.v or .weight)
vector is an array, so we use array notation

Breadth first search will always try and find the shortest distance
(least amount of hops)

Traversal is done when all nodes have been marked visited
start at the 0th index at the list, and go through all of the nodes.
